#Money Management - Credit Card Analysis

## Project Desciption (Self-study project):
I build a money management project that has the credit card analysis. The user can upload the credit card statement and the application will do the credit card analysis based on the uploaded statement for you. The application will prompt the user to enter the category for the store name if the category is not in the system(database). After entered all the categories, the application will have analysis result by category and the result by store name. User needs to save the categories that he/she enters so the user doesn't have to enter the categories again for those stores. 

The user also can see a list of the store names with categories and the user can edit or delete them. With all this features that mentioned above, the user can recognize how much he/she has spent in each categories and how much he/she has spent in each store for each month so he/she can control his/her budget accordingly.

##Requirements

##Important information
